This is a clone of work done by John Reese augmented with changes added by
code4fun, present on http://fluffy.mantisbt.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=20013.

Idea is to add some improvements:

1. configuration of issue statuses used on the Scrum Dashboard
2. configuration of CUSTOM FIELD or standard field to be used to indicate Spring
   (right now standard file Target version is used).
3. more ideas to come
